# Personal Site #

This is a personal site constructed with [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/ "Nesta") and basically consisting of various hacks to the Nesta website itself, to turn it into a useful academic site.  Eventually it will appear at my domain, but for now I'm simply testing it out on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku").

Many thanks to [Graham Ashton](https://github.com/gma "Graham Ashton"), whose huge amount of work enabled this small project.
