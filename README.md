## About ##

This is a personal academic site constructed with [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/ "Nesta").  It started with various hacks to the Nesta website itself, but has gradually evolved away.  The site is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/ "Railway.app") and can be accessed at [http://bweslake.org/](http://bweslake.org/ "http://bweslake.org/").  For more, see this [note](http://bweslake.org/blog/a-note-on-this-site "A Note on This Site").

### Parallelist ###

The site includes a theme, *Parallelist*, which is responsible for the visual style.  The theme is also responsible for specifying [Kramdown][kramdown] as the Markdown parser.  I choose Kramdown for two main reasons:

- It provides a nice clean implementation of the [PHP Markdown Extra][phpme] [footnote syntax][phpmefn];
- It provides an implementation of [math blocks][mathblocks], which can be written in [LaTeX][latex] and are displayed with the lovely [MathJax][mathjax] engine.

### Thanks ###

Many thanks to [Graham Ashton](https://github.com/gma "Graham Ashton"), whose fantastic work on Nesta enabled this small project.
