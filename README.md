## About ##

This is a personal academic site constructed with [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/ "Nesta").  It started with various hacks to the Nesta website itself, but has gradually evolved away.  The site is hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku") and can be accessed at [http://bweslake.org/](http://bweslake.org/ "http://bweslake.org/").  For more, see this [note](http://bweslake.org/blog/a-note-on-this-site "A Note on This Site").

Many thanks to [Graham Ashton](https://github.com/gma "Graham Ashton"), whose fantastic work on Nesta enabled this small project.
