### Maldini ###

I wrote [Maldini][maldini], a citation and bibliography plugin for [Nesta][nesta]. It allows citations and reference lists to be automatically generated from BibTeX files, using a syntax analogous to the commands used for the same purpose in LaTeX. For more information, see [here][maldini].

### BibTeX

* My 12,500+ entry [BibTeX][7] bibliography is available [here][8].
* Here are three Applescripts for use with BibDesk. Install by placing them in `~/Library/Application Support/BibDesk/Scripts`, which makes them available in the BibDesk Scripts menu. Each applies to the selected Bibdesk entry only.
  * [Transform <span class="small">DOI</span> fields to <span class="small">URL</span> fields][9].
  * [Transform Title and Booktitle fields to title case][10]. You will need to edit the script to point it to wherever you have placed [this script][11], on which it relies.
  * [Convert Unicode special characters to LaTeX escape sequences][12]. Operates on fields Title, Booktitle, Publisher, Author, Editor, and Address. You will need to edit the script to point it to wherever you have placed [this script][13], on which it relies.

### Workflow

I use [TextMate][1] for editing [Pandoc][pandoc] files, [LaTeX][2] for typesetting them, [BibDesk][3] for bibliography management, [biblatex][4] for bibliographic typesetting, and [Git][git] for version control. The [vc][vc] LaTeX package can be used to embed Git version information into PDFs, as for example in my [CV][cv] (see the very end).
