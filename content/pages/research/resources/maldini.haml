  ## Overview

  Maldini is a citation and bibliography plugin for [Nesta][nesta].  It allows citations and reference lists to be automatically generated from [BibTeX][bibtex] files, using a syntax analogous to the commands used for the same purpose in [LaTeX][latex]. It is intended to streamline the workflow of those who write content both in [LaTeX][latex] and for the web.  It is also intended as an advertisement for [Nesta][nesta] itself, particularly for academics.
  
  ## The Idea
  
  Suppose I am writing a paper on a topic, and wish to produce content both for the paper and for a series of blog posts on related topics.  If I am writing the paper in LaTeX, I should be keeping track of the references relevant to my paper in a bibliography management program such as [BibDesk][bibdesk], which stores those references in a BibTeX file.  The idea behind Maldini is simple: when I write content for my blog, I shouldn't have to manually copy and paste those references and their corresponding citations.  There are at least four reasons for this:
  
  1. Bibliographic information should be maintained in a single place, so that errors can be corrected once and then automatically propagated elsewhere.
  2. Producing reference information for web content should be both *simple* and *rigorous*. It should be simpler to produce a citation than copying and pasting the reference in full from somewhere else, and the reference produced should have the same rigour as in any other academic context.
  3. Reference lists should be *consistently formatted* to a common standard.
  4. Reference lists should *only contain things that have been cited*.
  
  ## Present Status
  
  The initial release of Maldini (0.0.1) makes some initial progress towards addressing these demands.  It includes the following features:

  #### Multiple Citation Styles

  Maldini provides the following citation styles, modeled on their [biblatex][biblatex] equivalents: `textcite`, `citeauthor`, `parencite`, and `fullcite` (examples of these styles can be seen below).

  #### Multiple BibTeX Entry Types

  Maldini supports the following BibTeX entry types: `article`, `book`, `inbook`, `incollection`, and `inproceedings` (others, including `unpublished` and `phdthesis`, are coming soon).

  #### Automatic Reference List Generation

  Maldini automatically generates reference lists that include all and only references cited with `textcite`, `parencite`, or `fullcite`.

  #### Automatic Sorting

  Maldini currently sorts the reference list by surname, then first name, then year.  So for example #{bib.textcite('smith_2005')} is listed prior to #{bib.textcite('smith_2007b')}, which is listed prior to #{bib.textcite('smith_2008a')}.

  ## Call for Collaboration
  
  As it stands, Maldini is little more than a proof-of-concept. There are *many* ways in which it should be improved, from the integrity of the existing code to the implementation of additional features.  The source for Maldini is hosted as a public [Github repository][maldinigithub], which contains a [README][maldinireadme] specifying outstanding issues and a wishlist of future improvements. Any help with the project would be appreciated, from user feedback to development collaboration.

  ## Announcements

  New versions of Maldini will be announced both on my [blog][blog] and on the Nesta [mailing list][nestalist].

  ## Usage
  
  At present, Maldini is implemented in terms of a class, `Maldini::Bibliography`, which provides a set of public methods with syntax modeled on [biblatex][biblatex] (chosen because it is rapidly becoming the LaTeX standard for interacting with BibTeX files).  The list of public methods can be seen in the Maldini [README][maldinireadme].
  
  ## Demonstration
  
  This page is itself a demonstration of Maldini in action.  The source from which it is generated can be browsed [here][src], and the BibTeX file it employs can be browsed [here][maldinibib]. Here are some citation examples, with a mix of citation style and BibTeX entry types:
      
  - Citation style `textcite`, entry type `article`: #{bib.textcite('hitchcock_2001b')}.
  - Citation style `textcite`, entry type `book`: #{bib.textcite('collins_hall_paul_book_2004')}.
  - Citation style `textcite`, entry type `inbook`: #{bib.textcite('fraassen_1989b')}.
  - Citation style `textcite`, entry type `incollection`: #{bib.textcite('halpern_2001')}.
  - Citation style `parencite`, entry type `article`: #{bib.parencite('mcdermott_2002')}.
  - Citation style `citeauthor`, entry type `book`: #{bib.citeauthor('collins_hall_paul_book_2004')}.
  - Citation style `textcite`, entry type `inproceedings`: #{bib.textcite('cartwright_1989a')}.
  - Citation style `fullcite`, entry type `book`: #{bib.fullcite('woodward_2003')}.

  And here is the corresponding reference list, which is automatically generated by Maldini:
