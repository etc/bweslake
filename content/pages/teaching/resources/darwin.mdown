### Overview

This is a collection of multimedia resources on the history and philosophy of the interaction between science and religion, with a particular focus on Darwin.  They are primarily designed to be a resource for a class on these topics, for example the one I teach with the evolutionary biologist [H. Allen Orr](http://www.rochester.edu/College/BIO/professors/orr.html) (see syllabus from [2010](../2010/darwin), [2012](../2012/darwin)).  Please [contact me](mailto:bradley.weslake@rochester.edu) with suggestions or broken links.
