  ### Overview
  This is a survey course in general philosophy of science. Our topics include: Is scientific knowledge different from other forms of knowledge? Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true?  What are scientific explanations, and what makes an explanation better than another? Do the laws of nature govern the world or simply encapsulate some interesting patterns in the world? What is the relationship between more and less fundamental scientific theories? We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science.

  ### Objectives
  The aim of this course is for students to significantly improve their capacity to:
  
  * Extract, explain and evaluate the arguments contained in philosophical texts.
  * Understand the central arguments and theories contained in the assigned readings.
  * Contribute to constructive philosophical discussion.
  * Write clear, concise, and well organised philosophical essays.

  ### Policies

  #### Attendance and Lateness

  Students are required to attend all classes on time. An explanation for every absence or late attendance must be submitted in writing to the instructor. Every failure to attend class on time will count against the component of the final grade awarded for attendance and participation, unless an explanation is received and approved at least one day prior to the class in question. Requests for exceptions will be considered on a case by case basis, and typically granted only when related to an illness or other unforeseeable change in life circumstance. Students who have been excessively absent will be considered to have unofficially withdrawn and will be given a final grade of F.

  #### Integrity

  It is a condition on passing this course that students read and adhere to the NYU Shanghai policy on academic integrity as described in the current [NYU Shanghai Academic Bulletin](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/curriculum/bulletin).
