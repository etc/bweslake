# Teaching

I have taught at undergraduate and postgraduate level in general philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of cognitive science, and philosophy of mind.  At Rochester, I regularly taught an interdisciplinary class on the history and philosophy of the relationship between science and religion with [H. Allen Orr](http://www.rochester.edu/College/BIO/professors/orr.html).  At NYU Shanghai, I regularly teach an interdisciplinary class in philosophy of technology with [Anna Greenspan](http://annagreenspan.com/). In addition to class syllabi, I maintain links to multimedia resources for the various areas in which I teach [here](/teaching/resources).
