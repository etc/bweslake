# Teaching

I teach general philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of mind and philosophy of technology. At Rochester, I regularly taught an interdisciplinary class on the history and philosophy of the relationship between science and religion with [H. Allen Orr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Allen_Orr). At NYU Shanghai, I regularly teach an interdisciplinary class in philosophy of technology with [Anna Greenspan](http://annagreenspan.com/). I also regularly teach [Global Perspectives on Society](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/is/course-spotlight-global-perspectives-society), a wide-ranging interdisciplinary course that is mandatory for all five hundred first year students.
