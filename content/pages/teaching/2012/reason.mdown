### Overview
This course is an introduction to the epistemological side of philosophy of science, focussing on questions concerning the nature of science. Epistemological questions in the philosophy of science are those concerning the nature of scientific knowledge: Is scientific knowledge different in principle from other forms of knowledge? If so, what makes it different?  Should the history of science be seen as an ever-increasing advance of knowledge, or should we see the historical development of science in some other terms? Given that most scientific theories have turned out to be false, are we justified in believing that our current theories are true?  We will examine these questions through readings drawn from both the history and philosophy of science.
