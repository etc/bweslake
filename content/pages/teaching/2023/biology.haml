  <blockquote class="caption">Part of Darwin's &ldquo;Diagram of Divergence of Taxa&rdquo;, the only diagram in <em>On The Origin of Species</em>.  The diagram depicts &ldquo;hypothetical phylogenetic relationships, showing how lineages diverge from common ancestors and give rise to both extinct and extant species. Time intervals (between Roman numerals) represent thousands of generations. [...] Distance along the horizontal axis represents degree of divergence (as, for example, in body form). Darwin recognized that rates of evolution vary greatly, showing this by different angles in the diagram&rdquo; (Futuyma, 2009, p. 21).  Note too that the diagram displays <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature07894">Darwin's recognition</a> that it is the most divergent species that are most likely to survive.  For the full diagram see <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=image&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=133">here</a>.</blockquote>

  ### Policies

  #### Attendance and Lateness

  Students are required to attend all classes on time. An explanation for every absence or late attendance must be submitted in writing to the instructor. Every failure to attend class on time will count against the component of the final grade awarded for attendance and participation, unless an explanation is received and approved at least one day prior to the class in question. Requests for exceptions will be considered on a case by case basis, and typically granted only when related to an illness or other unforeseeable change in life circumstance. Students who have been excessively absent will be considered to have unofficially withdrawn and will be given a final grade of F.

  #### Integrity

  It is a condition on passing this course that students read and adhere to the NYU Shanghai policy on academic integrity as described in the current [NYU Shanghai Academic Bulletin](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/curriculum/bulletin).
