Summary: A short note on the technologies used to construct this site.

# A Note on This Site

This site is constructed with [Nesta](http://nestacms.com/ "Nesta"), a very lightweight content management system.  I chose Nesta because it does everything I need, and nothing more.  Here are some of the features I find particularly attractive:

- Simple pages can be written with [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Markdown").
- More complex pages can be written with [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/ "Haml").
- Sitewide style can be managed with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/ "Sass").
- The entire site can be gracefully evolved using [Git](http://git-scm.com/ "git").
- The entire site can be previewed locally on any computer with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby").
- Hosting is free on [Railway](https://railway.app/ "Railway").
- Out of the box support for [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/ "Google Analytics").
- Out of the box support for [Disqus](http://disqus.com/ "Disqus").

All this means the normal workflow to add to or amend the site is something like this (all commands executed in the local site root directory):

1. Edit the file with [TextMate](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate").
3. Preview changes locally with: `thin start`
2. Commit the file with: `git commit -a`
4. Push the changes remotely with: `git push`

## Why Write with Markdown? ##

The central attraction of Markdown for me is the ease with which it can be used to generate web content on the one hand, *via* content management systems such as Nesta, and to generate print content on the other, *via* typesetting systems such as [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ "LaTeX").  Another attraction is the clean and minimal syntax, which makes the source file itself much easier to read than ordinary HTML.

## Why Use Git? ##

Git is an enormously simple version control system.  In addition to making it easy to restore earlier versions of the site, Git makes it very easy to share code with others.  For example, the entire source of this site can be found [here](http://github.com/etc/bweslake "bweslake.org source on GitHub"), and I am happy for others to make use of whichever parts they like.
