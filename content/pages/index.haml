    I work in philosophy of science, metaphysics and philosophy of mind.  My main projects at present concern levels of explanation in the sciences, the use of causal models to analyse token causation, the temporal asymmetry of causation, and the exclusion problem in philosophy of mind.

    #### online
    I edit the category [Explanation][exp] in the [PhilPapers][pp] project, and am a contributor to the philosophy of science weblog [It's Only a Theory][only] and the metaphysics weblog [Matters of Substance][substance].
