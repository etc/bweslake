	abstract = {This chapter first summarizes John Locke's personal connections with America, alerting that biography cannot determine authorial intention or philosophical coherence. Next, it surveys Locke's preoccupation with anthropology, noting that his attitude to non‐Europeans was by no means wholly negative. Locke's political and moral philosophy was richly informed by literature we would today call anthropological. The chapter then sketches early‐modern arguments for empire, in order to exclude some possibilities from Locke's repertoire, before turning to Locke's manifesto for English agrarian development in the Americas. This is followed by a brief juxtaposition of Locke and African slavery. Finally, several difficulties are raised about the postcolonial case, which render Locke's position altogether more ambiguous than it may seem. Locke is sometimes ambiguous about the reason for American failings, Locke attributes their subsistence economy to lack of commercial opportunity, the absence of money and the markets it engenders.},

@article{arneil_1996a,
	abstract = { Locke's theory of property in the Two Treatises of Government is shaped by his deep involvement in the development of colonial policy, as secretary to both the Lord Proprietors of Carolina and the Council of Trade and Plantations. This article will demonstrate the extent to which chapter five of the Second Treatise mirrors the arguments made both by the ethical and economic defenders of the English plantation. By calling America vacant, by beginning property in land through enclosure and cultivation and limiting it to that which does not spoil, and by introducing money and international commerce as the means by which the spoilage proviso can be transcended, Locke incorporates both an ethical justification for taking Indian occupied land and economic reasons for favouring settled agrarian based colonies. Thus, embedded within Locke's theory of property is a vigorous economic and ethical defence of England's colonial activities in the new world. },

@article{mower_2013,
	abstract = {Situationist research in social psychology focuses on the situational factors that influence behavior. Doris and Harman argue that this research has powerful implications for ethics, and virtue ethics in particular. First, they claim that situationist research presents an empirical challenge to the moral psychology presumed within virtue ethics. Second, they argue that situationist research supports a theoretical challenge to virtue ethics as a foundation for ethical behavior and moral development. I offer a response from moral psychology using an interpretation of Xunzi---a Confucian virtue ethicist from the Classical period. This Confucian account serves as a foil to the situationist critique in that it uncovers many problematic ontological and normative assumptions at work in this debate regarding the prediction and explanation of behavior, psychological posits, moral development, and moral education. Xunzi's account of virtue ethics not only responds to the situationist empirical challenge by uncovering problematic assumptions about moral psychology, but also demonstrates that it is not a separate empirical hypothesis. Further, Xunzi's virtue ethic responds to the theoretical challenge by offering a new account of moral development and a ground for ethical norms that fully attends to situational features while upholding robust character traits.},

Section 1 offers a brief defense of the relevance of experimental philosophy to the free will debate. Section 2 reviews a series of articles in the experimental literature that probe intuitions about the ``compatibility question''---whether we can be free and morally responsible if determinism is true. Section 3 argues that these studies have produced valuable insights on the factors that influence our judgments on the compatibility question, but that their general approach suffers from significant practical and philosophical difficulties. Section 4 reviews experimental work addressing other aspects of the free will/moral responsibility debate, and section 5 concludes with a discussion of avenues for further research.},

@article{sripada_2012,
	abstract = {Incompatibilists and compatibilists (mostly) agree that there is a strong intuition that a manipulated agent, i.e., an agent who is the victim of methods such as indoctrination or brainwashing, is unfree. They differ however on why exactly this intuition arises. Incompatibilists claim our intuitions in these cases are sensitive to the manipulated agent's lack of ultimate control over her actions, while many compatibilists argue that our intuitions respond to damage inflicted by manipulation on the agent's psychological and volitional capacities. Much hangs on this issue because manipulation-based arguments are among the most important for defending incompatibilist views of free will. In this paper, I investigate this issue from a experimental perspective, using a set of statistical methods well suited for identifying the features of hypothetical cases people's intuitions are responding to. Results strongly support the compatibilist view---subjects' tendency to judge that a manipulated agent is unfree was found to depend on their judgments that the agent suffers impairments to certain psychological/volitional capacities that compatibilists say are the basis for free will. I discuss the significance of these results for the use of manipulation cases in the philosophical debate about free will.},

To live a philosophical life is therefore to live consistently on the basis of reason so conceived in everything that we do. Socrates had a quite particular conception, not followed by all his successors in this tradition, of what living on the basis of reason entailed; those particularities are explored. For both Socrates and all his successors, being a philosopher and living a philosophical life meant living according to reason, conceived as a capacity for argument and analysis in pursuit of the truth.},

	abstract = {While over fifty different minority nationalities are officially recognized to exist in the People's Republic of China (PRC), well over 90 percent of the population are classified as Han, a term translated in English as ethnic Chinese or Chinese of native stock. After the fall of the Qing Empire, racial theories continued to underpin Chinese nationalism. Politics have been essential in the making of racial discourse in modern China. Racial theories were dependent on science, which only appeared in parts of Europe from the late eighteenth century onwards before emerging elsewhere across the globe. Racial classifications between different population groups were so important that they often preceded and shaped real social encounters. Racial nationalism portrays frontier countries, from Taiwan to Tibet, as organic parts of the sacred territory of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor that should be defended by military force if necessary.},

@article{bamshad_2003,
	abstract = {Over the past few years, scientists have collected data about the genetic constitution of populations around the world in an effort to probe the link between ancestry and patterns of disease. Common definitions of race do sometimes work well to divide groups according to genetically determined propensities for certain diseases. A research team examined 100 different Alu polymorphisms in 565 people born in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Europe, and found that genetic analyses can distinguish groups of people according to their geographic origin. Scientists have also identified millions of polymorphisms in the human genome. The distribution of these polymorphisms across populations reflects the history of those populations and the effects of natural selection. The mutations responsible for sickle cell disease and some cases of cystic fibrosis, for instance, result from genetic changes that appear to have risen in frequency because they were protective against diseases prevalent in Africa and Europe, respectively. Genetic variation also plays a role in individual susceptibility to one of the worst scourges of our age: AIDS. Until further studies are done on the genetic and environmental contributions to complex diseases, physicians may have to rely on information about an individual's ancestry to know how best to treat some diseases. A set of articles in the March 20 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine debated both sides of the medical implications of race.},

The resulting interpretation focuses attention on the religious aspects of Confucianism and accounts for aspects of the text that are otherwise difficult to explain. In addition, the author argues that the structural similarities between the Aristotelian and Confucian conceptions of self-cultivation indicate a dimension of commensurability between the two traditions, despite very real variations in specific content.

	abstract = {Disjunctivist theories of perceptual experience claim that veridical and non-veridical experiences are radically unalike in some respect (other than the obvious difference in their causal histories). This chapter outlines four ways of elaborating this basic claim, each motivated by a different concern. The first is disjunctivism about the objects of experience, motivated by Direct Realism. The second is disjunctivism about the content of experience, motivated by the view that some experiences have object-dependent content. The third is disjunctivism about perceptual evidence (also known as epistemological disjunctivism), which is a strategy for responding to a particular sort of argument for scepticism about the external world. The fourth is disjunctivism about the metaphysical structure of experience (also known as metaphysical disjunctivism), which is motivated by Na{\"\i}ve Realism (a species of Direct Realism).},

	abstract = {Buddhists believe that the existence of an enduring self is an illusion and that this illusion is the root of the suffering inherent in the human condition. I want to explore whether this 
particular Buddhist thought can be understood in terms familiar to analytic philosophy. How might the illusion of an enduring self lie at the root of human suffering? After explaining the sense in which the enduring self is indeed an illusion, I argue that this illusion goes hand-in-hand with another -- namely, the illusion of the passage of time. Seeming to be an enduring self, even though one is not, is what makes time seem to pass, even though it does not. And the appearance that time passes, I argue, is the source of the suffering that is alleviated when both illusions are dispelled.},

The popular faith in continuity of consciousness and the unity of the person is subjected to sustained criticism.

Does responsibility for the consequences of our acts require that they were intended or simply expected? How have a number of influential previous philosophers, including Aristotle, Maimonides, and Spinoza, approached these questions?

@book{sober_2008,
	abstract = {How should the concept of evidence be understood? And how does the concept of evidence apply to the controversy about creationism, and also to work in evolutionary biology about natural selection and common ancestry? In this rich and wide-ranging book, Elliott Sober investigates general questions about probability and evidence and shows how the answers he develops to those questions apply to the specifics of evolutionary biology. Drawing on a set of fascinating examples, he analyses whether claims about intelligent design are untestable; whether they are discredited by the fact that many adaptations are imperfect; whether it is possible to know that present species trace back to common ancestors; how it is possible to test hypotheses about natural selection and many other issues. His book will interest all readers who want to understand philosophical questions about evidence and evolution, as they arise both in Darwin's work and contemporary biological research.
