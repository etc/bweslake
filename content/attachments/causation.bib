	Abstract = {One of the most striking features of causation is that causes typically precede their effects -- the causal arrow is strongly aligned with the temporal arrow. Why should this be so? We offer an opinionated guide to this problem, and to the solutions currently on offer. We conclude that the most promising strategy is to begin with the de facto asymmetry of human deliberation, characterised in epistemic terms, and to build out from there. More than any rival, this subjectivist approach promises to demystify the asymmetry, temporal orientation, and deliberative relevance of causal judgements.

@book{strevens_2008b,
	Abstract = {In this book I propose a new account of scientific explanation, which I call the kairetic account. The kairetic account is a causal account of explanation; to explain a phenomenon is to tell some kind of story about how the phenomenon was or is causally produced. More precisely, the kairetic account belongs to that class of causal explanations according to which an explanation makes clear which aspects of the process of causal production make a difference to whether or not the phenomenon to be explained is produced.

Although the causal approach to explanation is popular, it has never, in my view, been worked out particularly well. Prior causal accounts have focused on the process of causal production, but have either denied the importance of or left undeveloped the account of difference-making. By contrast, I pay relatively little attention to the process of causal production itself, and focus on giving an account of difference-making that will fit with any particular view of causal production.

The most important feature of the picking out of difference-makers, on my conception of difference-making, is that it is a kind of abstraction: to specify the difference-makers in some causal process is to single out certain properties of the process while leaving others unmentioned.

The notion of difference-making as abstraction leads to a rich causal treatment of many aspects of explanation that have been either ignored or (in my view) mishandled by earlier advocates of the causal approach. These include:

    * Theoretical explanation, that is, explanation of laws and other generalizations
    * Probabilistic explanation in deterministic systems, as in statistical physics, evolutionary biology, medical science, and social science.
    * Idealization in explanation

The result is an account of explanation that has especially interesting consequences for the higher level sciences: biology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences. },

	Abstract = {An influential tradition in the philosophy of causation has it that all token causal facts are, or are reducible to, facts about difference-making. Challenges to this tradition have typically focused on pre-emption cases, in which a cause apparently fails to make a difference to its effect. However, a novel challenge to the difference-making approach has recently been issued by Alyssa Ney. Ney defends causal foundationalism, which she characterizes as the thesis that facts about difference-making depend upon facts about physical causation. She takes this to imply that causation is not fundamentally a matter of difference-making. In this paper, I defend the difference-making approach against Ney's argument. I also offer some positive reasons for thinking, pace Ney, that causation is fundamentally a matter of difference-making.},

@article{ney_2009,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between physical theories of causation and theories of difference-making. It is plausible to think that such theories are compatible with one another as they are aimed at different targets: the former, an empirical account of actual causal relations; the latter, an account that will capture the truth of most of our ordinary causal claims. The question then becomes: what is the relationship between physical causation and difference-making? Is one kind of causal fact more fundamental than the other? This paper defends causal foundationalism: the view that facts about difference-making are dependent on the obtaining of facts about physical causation. However, the paper's main goal is to clarify the structure of the debate. At the end of the paper, it is shown how settling the issue about the relationship between physical theories of causation and theories of difference-making has more than mere intrinsic interest in unifying the very different pursuits that have been undertaken in the philosophy of causation. It can help to break a stalemate that has arisen in the current debate about mental causation.

	Abstract = {In this paper I articulate RVC with an eye to two things: first, its conceptual development; second, its basic commitments and implications for what causation is. I have chosen to present RVC in a way that respects its historical origins and unravels the steps of its articulation in the face of objections and criticism. It is important for the explication and defence of RVC to see it as a view of causation that emerged in a certain intellectual milieu. RVC has been developed as an attempt to remove efficiency from causation and hence, to view causation not as a productive relation but as a relation of dependence among discrete events. In particular, the thought that causation is regularity is meant to oppose metaphysical views of causation that posit powers or other kinds of entity that are supposed to enforce the regularities that there are in the world or to explain the alleged necessity that there is in causation.},

Causation is not to be analysed in terms of counterfactual dependency at all, no matter how many equants and epicycles are appended to the original rough draft. The systematic connections between judgements about causes and judgements about counterfactuals can be explained by the involvement of a third factor, some component of the truth conditions of counterfactual claims that is also a component of the truth conditions for causal claims. This third factor would provide the analogue of a `common cause' explanation for the systematic connections between causal claims and counterfactuals: neither underpins the other but the third factor underpins them both.},

@book{mackie_1974,
	Abstract = {  In this book, J. L. Mackie makes a careful study of several philosophical issues involved in his account of causation. Mackie follows Hume's distinction between causation as a concept and causation as it is `in the objects' and attempts to provide an account of both aspects. Mackie examines the treatment of causation by philosophers such as Hume, Kant, Mill, Russell, Ducasse, Kneale, Hart and Honore, and von Wright. Mackie's own account involves an analysis of causal statements in terms of counterfactual conditionals though these are judged to be incapable of giving a complete account of causation. Mackie argues that regularity theory too can only offer an incomplete picture of the nature of causation. In the course of his analysis, Mackie critically examines the account of causation offered by Kant, as well as the contemporary Kantian approaches offered by philosophers such as Bennett and Strawson. Also addressed are issues such as the direction of causation, the relation of statistical laws and functional laws, the role of causal statements in legal contexts, and the understanding of causes both as `facts' and `events'. Throughout the discussion of these topics, Mackie develops his own complex account of the nature of causation, finally bringing his analysis to bear in regard to the topic of teleology and the question of whether final causes can be justifiably reduced to efficient causes.},
