Parallelist Nesta Theme
=======================

parallelist is a theme for Nesta, intended for use on personal academic sites, designed by Brad Weslake.  It can be seen in action at [https://bweslake.org/](https://bweslake.org/ "https://bweslake.org/").  I've not tried to plug it into a site with different content yetâ€”use at your own risk.
